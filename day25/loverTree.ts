/**
 * A LoverTree is a magical tree that grows in pairs.
 * It's the garden elfs favourite tree species.
 *
 * The pair grows in turns. First one grows, then the other.
 * A branch never grows to a space where another branch can also grow.
 * Who knows, if that's a space where the lover grows in the future?
 *
 * The purpose of a lover tree pair is to first grow safely without
 * blocking self or the other.
 *
 * After growing, the trees extend individual branches to meet in a free
 * space between them. The more branches meet, the better the embracement.
 *
 * By understanding these trees, we could perhaps understand the wires.
 * Nature is so amazing. Always has a solution to everything.
